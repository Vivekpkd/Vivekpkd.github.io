# ADAS Fundamentals

Self-driving cars aren't magic. They are a fusion of sensors.

## Sensor Fusion
1.  **Radar**: Good for speed and distance (Adaptive Cruise Control). Works in fog/rain.
2.  **Lidar**: Creates 3D point cloud maps. Expensive but accurate.
3.  **Cameras**: Good for object classification (Stop signs, Lanes).

## The Perception Loop
1.  **Sense**: Gather raw data.
2.  **Perceive**: Detect objects and lanes.
3.  **Plan**: Calculate path.
4.  **Act**: Steer and Accelerate.

# 🚀 Success!

If you are reading this as a generated HTML page, it means the **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline** is working perfectly.

### What was tested:
1. **Trigger**: Pushing a new `.md` file to the `content/` directory.
2. **Execution**: The `Build Markdown to HTML` workflow started automatically.
3. **Build**: The `build.py` script was executed in the cloud environment.
4. **Commit**: The generated HTML was committed and pushed back to the repository.
5. **Deployment**: GitHub Pages updated to show this new article.

> [!TIP]
> This automation ensures that your portfolio stays updated without you ever needing to run a build script locally!
